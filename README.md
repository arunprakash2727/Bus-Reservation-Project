# Simple Bus Reservation System in Java

## Description

The "BusReservation" package contains classes that simulate a basic bus reservation system in Java. Here's an overview of the classes included:

- **Booking**: Manages user bookings by obtaining details like name, bus number, and journey date.
- **BookingDao**: Handles database operations related to bookings, such as checking availability and adding bookings.
- **Bus**: Represents bus details like bus number, AC availability, and capacity.
- **BusDao**: Manages operations related to buses, including retrieving bus information and capacity.
- **DBConnection**: Manages the database connection using JDBC.
- **Main**: The main class orchestrating the entire booking process.

This system offers a simplified demonstration of bus reservations, enabling users to check bus availability, book seats, and perform basic bus-related operations.

## Important Note

The provided code serves as a fundamental illustration for educational purposes. It lacks several features necessary for a production-level bus reservation system. Enhancements such as error handling, security measures, and scalability considerations are essential for real-world implementation.

This repository serves as a learning resource to comprehend foundational concepts related to building a bus reservation system using Java and SQL databases.
